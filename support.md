#### 📊 Version Stages

Whenever I update the modpack to a new version of Minecraft, I first publish it under the `🧪 Alpha` status, indicating that it may not be fully playable and could have several issues. As updates progress, it moves to `🔧 Beta`, and finally to `🚀 Release` status, reflecting improvements in stability, performance, and features.

The table below shows the equivalent terms used in Minecraft updates:

| Minecraft      | Bedrock Reloaded |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 🧪 Snapshot    | 🧪 Alpha         |
| 🔧 Pre-release | 🔧 Beta          |
| 🚀 Release     | 🚀 Release       |
